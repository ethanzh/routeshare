# UT Routeshare

## TODO:
- [x] Construct list of coordinates based on start and end point
- [x] Scrape for all UT building addresses
- [x] Retrieve building from unique course ID
- [x] Create map visualizations between two courses
- [ ] Tidy pdf_extract.py code
- [ ] Create back-end for user log-in, info input

This is a program where users will be able to add friends via their UTEID or UT e-mails.

Every user inputs their current 5 digit unique course numbers, and the program will inform
users which paths "line-up" with theirs friends (assuming they take the quickest path from
class to class)
